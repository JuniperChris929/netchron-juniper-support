<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">I was tired of remembering the needed commands (and probably forgetting some) and the manual time it took me to collect all the Infos.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Simply run this script in python or use the compiled .exe (created via pyinstaller).</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="8">The .exe is uesful when you donâ€™t have python on your (or your customers) machine.<br>
Simply run it, give it the Switches IP, user and password and sit back.</p>

This is my first time programming in python - be gentle ;)</p>
</p>Simply upload all files in the "configuration", "core-dump", "logfiles" and "rsi" folder to JTAC.
</p>&nbsp;
</p>Do NOT upload the njsupport-live.log - this is for your Info only in case something in the script goes wrong.
</p>JTAC will probably not know what to do with that file because it contains almost nothing about your Device ;)
